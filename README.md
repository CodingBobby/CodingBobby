### Hey!

You can call me Bob and I'm mostly writing in Python and JavaScript. I also use LaTeX to write documents.

#### What I'm currently working on
- My redesigned [blog](https://codingbobby.xyz)
- [Traktify](https://github.com/CodingBobby/traktify) which is a desktop client for [trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv)
- [Rectipy](https://github.com/CodingBobby/rectipy) which is intended to be useful for students in chemical engineering (like myself)
- Study projects that take up a lot of time
